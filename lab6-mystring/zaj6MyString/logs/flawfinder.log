/tmp/tmph6wpmps7/student/zaj6MyString/mystring.cpp:15:29:  [1] (buffer) mismatch:Function does not check the second iterator for over-read conditions (CWE-126).  This function is often discouraged by most C++ coding standards in favor of its safer alternatives provided since C++14. Consider using a form of this function that checks the second iterator before potentially overflowing it. 
    std::pair result = std::mismatch(string_text.begin(), string_text.end(), string.begin());
